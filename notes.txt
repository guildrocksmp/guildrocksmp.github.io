To achieve this task, you can follow the following steps:

Identify the YouTube channel you want to display on your webpage. You will need the channel's URL or channel ID.

Obtain a YouTube Data API key, which will allow you to access data from the YouTube API.

Use the YouTube API to retrieve information about the channel, including the channel's most recent videos.

Filter the list of videos based on your criteria, i.e., videos with a certain string in the title.

Display the filtered videos on your webpage, in the order you want them to appear.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the steps:

Identify the YouTube channel: First, you need to know the channel's URL or channel ID. You can find this by going to the YouTube channel and copying the URL from the browser address bar or by right-clicking on the channel icon and selecting "Copy link address."

Obtain a YouTube Data API key: You will need to sign up for a Google Developers account to obtain an API key. Once you have a Google Developers account, create a new project and enable the YouTube Data API. Then generate an API key.

Use the YouTube API to retrieve information about the channel: You can use the API to retrieve a list of the channel's most recent videos. The API endpoint for this is https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search, and you will need to pass in the channelId parameter along with your API key.

Filter the list of videos based on your criteria: Once you have the list of videos, you can filter it based on your criteria, i.e., videos with a certain string in the title. You can use string manipulation functions to check if the title contains the desired string.

Display the filtered videos on your webpage: Finally, you can display the filtered videos on your webpage in the order you want them to appear. You can use HTML and JavaScript to create a video player and list the videos.

great, what programming languages might I need for the task? Is Python a good backend?
Yes, Python is a good choice for the backend of this task as it has several libraries that make working with APIs and manipulating data easier, such as requests and pandas. You can use Python to send requests to the YouTube API, retrieve the data, and manipulate it to filter out the videos you need.

In addition to Python, you will likely need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend of the webpage. HTML is used for creating the webpage structure, CSS for styling the webpage, and JavaScript for adding interactivity to the webpage, such as a video player.

You may also consider using a web framework such as Flask or Django for the backend to simplify the development process and handle routing requests from the frontend to the backend. Additionally, you may want to consider using a templating engine such as Jinja2 to generate the HTML templates dynamically based on the filtered videos retrieved from the YouTube API.
